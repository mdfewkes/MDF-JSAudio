`~`~` Snowball:
full check sfxContainerPlayDelayRandom (how does "is playing" work?)
fullproof callback event
rename getEventSecondsRemaining to getTimerEventSecondsRemaining, or expand it for move types

devirtualize past end point, what happens? music can catch
look at set time (example musicClipOverlap)
musicClip not devirtualizing when the volume comes back up
